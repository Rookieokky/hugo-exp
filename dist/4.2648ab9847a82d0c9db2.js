I worked at a digital agency, SapientNitro, where I was responsible for creating modular - reusable web components using just HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript. We were only allowed to use jQuery & GreenSock’s TweenMax animation library, as the client whom project team I was on wanted very little third-party libraries. I really learned a lot about working in a fast pace environment and how to organize my time to finish my contributions to meet deadlines as well as the strengths JavaScript provided within a browser environment."),f=n("p",{},void 0,"Before being granted the opportunity to be a Front End developer at SapientNitro, I had completed a freelance project for a client I met at Starbucks. The project was a landing page built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, & Bootstrap and it had to also allow for clients to connect with the owner of the company through email; so I built a web server with NodeJS to handle sending emails directly from the landing page. I then became more interested in Back End development with NodeJS and thus became the prologue towards becoming more Full Stack Savvy."),h=n("p",{},void 0,"Recently, I was given the opportunity to work at my first start up, Callpal App, LLC where they had developed an app Callpal App; purposed to allow users to make calls, app-to-app, or app-to-landline, for free. During my role there as a Software-Engineer, I was tasked with various back-end systems that needed to: migrate data from MySQL to Couchbase stores, restructure data for in house analytics and for B2B teams. The RESTful APIs were built on top of NodeJS and there I learned to work in an Agile environment where I had to explain my progress in detail to my executives and team members every step of the way during and after the completion of tasks posted and managed by JIRA."),v=n("p",{},void 0,"As you can see, aside from a few personal projects and collegiate level programming workload, I have obtained professional experience in both front-end and back-end development.
